###Ruby on Rails: Week 3 Newsletter

This was a big week for the Learn Ruby on Rails class because we finally moved our focus from command line and git to Ruby!  While it is exciting to be beginning our journey with Ruby, these initial lessons are really about continuing to build our knowledge of the Command Line, Git and Pivotal Tracker.  We are now working on branching, rebasing, detailed commit messages and merging our work with our master branch, with a bit of Ruby syntax mixed in.  We added Rubocop to notify us in real time of “offensive code” and just added Travis Cl to run cucumber and other testing tools on our code each time we check it in. The information has been coming at us fast, but we’re up for the challenge.

This week also brought many of us together with our Mentors.  From one-on-one sessions to group meetings, everyone has benefitted from the knowledge and experience our mentors bring.  Most all of these Mentors were once in our shoes, students in this very class, and hearing their experiences (and struggles!!) makes us all feel better about where we are in this learning process.

Many of us enjoyed some extracurricular activities this week by attending some of the lectures and events around Denver Startup Week.  Whether it was a social happy hour to rub elbows with those in the industry or hearing thought leaders share their wisdom, many of us have taken advantage of this exciting event.  Even our gallant leader, our instructor, Jason Noble, shared his experience on a panel about (what else!) coding bootcamps.

Each student has also begun sharing stories, experiences and things they’ve learned through blogs.  Follow our journey with us!!
