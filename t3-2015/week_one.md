## DaVinci Coders - Ruby on Rails | Week One Newsletter

Our first class was on Monday, September 14, 2015.  We began class by introducing ourselves to each other with our “17 interesting things”.  This allowed everyone to get to know each other a little bit and ease any pre-existing tensions.  Among the interesting things; Sergey is originally from Ukraine, we have several rock climbers, cyclists, an epidemiologist, a nurse, and so on.  We’re a unique bunch!

We then sat down to our computers to figure out what all of the applications were that we installed on the Saturday before.  We went through a presentation of each application, making sure everyone had indeed installed it, and learned its function and purpose.  The list included Chrome, RubyMine, GitX, Anki, Evernote, Skitch, Flycut, Spectacle, Growl, Google Plus, Slack, Heroku, and BitTorrent Sync.  All of these applications and programs make-up what is needed, not only for the duration of the course, but rather throughout the career of a junior Ruby on Rails developer.

Like every first class ever, we also covered what is expected of us in this course.  Going through the syllabus, the do’s and don’ts, and of course; watching Pat Morita throw-down some knowledge on Ralph Macchio.

On Wednesday, we learned how to learn. Not just how to learn programming, but a variety of useful and proven techniques to accelerate and solidify our understanding of any given topic. Among the most useful techniques were the repetition of freshly learned material, spaced repetition of the same material over a period of time (with the assistance of  Anki), and the “interleaving” of different concepts while studying to keep our memory nimble. Another form of learning that has been found to actually assist, rather than inhibit the learning process is called generation. In doing so, the learner engages in generating a possible solution to a problem that they haven’t been shown how to solve yet. These, along with a few other learning methods, will be our newfound approach to learning how to code in the coming weeks.

Also on Wednesday, we were introduced to Pivotal Tracker. Along with seeing it’s features and functionality for the first time, Jason instructed us on best practice while using Pivotal Tracker for our homework assignments and general workflow. At this time, some of us had our first exposure to real working definitions of what a ‘feature’, ‘bug’, ‘chore’, and ‘release’ are. Gaining new insight into the software held promise of a structured and productive protocol in our method to doing work in the class as well as in the real world.

TGIF! Our first Friday started off with a quiz on what we learned on Wednesday. We weren’t expecting it to be too difficult but Jason did drop in a couple of curve balls. After grading the quizzes and assigning points to all the posses, we started our intro to Git and its staging areas.

Going over Git was the first time we really started working with the command line. We initialized a new git repository in iTerm and went over init, status, add, commit, and push (push it real good). We committed a few changes to the practice repo to get a good handle with how to use git.

The final thing for week one was more Pivotal Tracker. While it was mostly covered on Wednesday, we needed to spend some more time on Friday because of how important it is to the workflow and also to submit our assignments. Our assignment was to finish the first chapter of ‘Learn Command Line the hard way’ and submit it as a Pivotal Tracker story.

It feels like week one breezed by (only 12 more to go!). We’ve got a lot to look forward to and a lot of hard work left. If week one is any indication, we’ve got a great instructor, assistants, mentors and some pretty cool students too. We can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with for their final project!
