### Shoutouts

> * Nyla  - Very big shoutout to Jason for accommodating my missed assessment on Wednesday by holding a special screenhero session and for being an awesome teacher in general. Also, shoutout to Tim and Zach for extra help.

> * Sue - Kudos to Zach for helping me work a problem with detached heads in github. His prior experience in his own work helped me find a pattern that solved my multiple branch issue. Kudos to Jason for sitting in the conference room all Saturday while we came and went with questions and conversation. The conversations around code is what helps me the most.

> * Ryan Spittler helped Sue with formatting issues in a blog post about detached HEADS.

> * Tim - Shoutout to [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/) for giving me extremely insightful bedtime reading to get me more familiar with Git

> * Riley - Thank you Tim for helping me with obscure beginner problems that I created with my Git repo

### Week 5 - In Review

For the past couple of weeks, we have been starting to implement testing into our coding practice. We set up a testing service called [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) that is integrated with GitHub to monitor our homework branches in the learning_by_doing repository. We also set up a testing tool called `cucumber` that can be initiated manually whenever we like, but we usually did so after coding. Rubocop enforced code formatting conventions during code entry that were mostly annoying, yet often caught typos that explained why a program was not operating as we expected.

This week in class we dove into the details test driven development (TDD)dived into the details of testing,  and expandeding upon the software development techniquesideas that we were exposed to in earlier weeks., We learned to use commonby using testing tools such as rspec, using  and guard to run rspec for us, and exercisms. , and learned how to use a practice application called [exercism](http://exercism.io/). Specifically, we used exercism and the minitest gem to make a HelloWorld class and were exposed to the way that the testing application can be used to practice solving problems in Ruby.

We had a taste for testing from cucumber and travis runs that were enforced upon our committed and pushed changes to our feature branched repository, learning_by_doing. Travis tests occur after coding, and cucumber tests could be initiated manually whenever we like, but we usually did so after coding. Rubocop enforced code formatting conventions during code entry that were mostly annoying, yet often caught mis-types that explained why a code run was not operating as we expected.

To learn Test Driven Design this week, we practiced the “Generation” style of learning reviewed at the beginning of this course in the “Making it Stick” set of slides. Here is what happened.. We went over Rspec in detail for our Monday lecture, THEN we were introduced to the Test Driven Design methodology (that Rspec uses heavily) for our Friday lecture. It was rewarding to learn the “why” after learning the “what” in great detail. Now we are revisiting the “what” in new homework exercises. That’s our “Spaced Retrieval Practice” at work.

Midweek, for our Assesments, In addition, we had our first assessment for the class. These assessments are a way for us to calibrate ourselves and gain some insight into our development as coders. Our assessment tested to see if we could create a new we individually created Git repositoryRepositories and manage the normal setup for a ruby project such as the walked through the setups for ruby version manager (RVM)rvm,  rubocop guard, and Gemfiles. Then, we created a class and several its essential instance methods and instance variables settings.. first the long way and then the short way (attr_reader).. The assessment also tested our ability to read output from guard using the rubocop gem. For example, we were asked to create a method using `def` that simply printed out the value of an instance variable. When rubocop raised a warning about this method, we were expected to use `attr_reader` instead.


On Friday we used exercism and minitest to make a HelloWorld class and were exposed to the way that the testing can be used to practice solving programming problems in Ruby.
