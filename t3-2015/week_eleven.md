### Week 11 - In Review

This week became a single classroom day as most folk practiced the Work Life Balance aspect of Programming.

On Monday we reviewed the Active Record Associations. Namely, belongs_to, has_one, has_many, and has_many_through. Then we reviewed the concepts concretely by applying them to our active_record_associations in_class app that we began last week. We had a bit of deja-vu as some of the solutions were already applied to the code we were reviewing. This gave us an opportunity to Reverse-Engineer some of the solutions and review exactly why they did what they did.
