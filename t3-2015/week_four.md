## Week Four Confessions from our Ruby on Rails Student Developer Posse

### To the DaVinci Community,

  We started the week with a look at the Agile retrospective meeting.  Part of the Agile project management methodology,
these meetings are held after certain milestones to discuss what went well, what needs improvement, and what action 
items need to be addressed in the weeks to come.  The class held a productive meeting and suggested several opportunities 
for improvement.  These types of meetings are frequently held in real-world software development environments and are yet 
another way that Da Vinci Coders helps students prepare for the workplace.

  We've continued our transition from focusing on the software tools that professional coders use every day to focusing 
on the nuts and bolts of the Ruby programming language.  On Monday, we covered methods and flow control.  Methods are 
the ‘verbs’ of the programming world.  They allow programmers to capture frequently used procedures and add new 
functionality to their software objects. Flow control, to guide the execution of our programs.

   We were introduced to flow control by an exploration of branching, loops, and Boolean expressions.  Branching allows 
our code to make decisions by using if statements and else statements.  Loops are used to execute a single method 
multiple times.  Finally, Boolean expressions are used to evaluate the truth or falsity of various expressions in the 
program.  Basically, we now understand how to make our Ruby programs decide the truth or falsity of various statements, 
make decisions based on those truth values, and execute our methods until we get the results that we’re looking for.  
We’ve put this new understanding to the test by coding the infamous Fizzbuzz program, a program that’s frequently used 
in programming interviews.

We kicked off Wednesday, October 7, with a lively inter-posse programming contest, which proved to be easier than 
anticipated with the built-in “random” class in the Ruby language. After we reassembled as a group, we went over a few 
possible solutions to the number picking program with Jason’s guidance. The remainder of the class was devoted to 
learning about methods, recursion, and arrays. We learned how to define a method, set parameters, and refactor a line of 
code into a method using RubyMine. An important note to the idea of using methods in Ruby is the DRY (Don’t Repeat 
Yourself) principle, in which you strive to not repeat functional code within a program. Jason introduced us to the 
concept of recursion by calling a method from within itself. We were also shown how arrays work and how they can be used.

Friday was more of a creative day. In order to get a better grasp of classes and methods we programmed a card game in 
Ruby as a class exercise. By popular demand, we decided on Gold Fish. It was a great way to learn classes and methods 
and a great way to see how Object Oriented Programming works. Everything we’ve been doing so far has been a stepping-stone 
to get us to where we are and visualizing the program as a card game was awesome. We are flying through the class and have 
been immersed in code!
