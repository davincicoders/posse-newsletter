Week 6 Newsletter

This week here at Davinci Coders, it was much of the same. Yet, at the same time, all very new… We got back our grades 
for the first assessment, which was over making classes and methods. 
The assessment covered the entire process from making a git repo, to setting up our environment. On Monday, we went over step by step how the instructor would answer the assessment questions.

We continued to cover test driven development, which is a very interesting and 
frustrating way to write code. You write a failing test, then make it pass; doing this for every small step of the process. 
We implemented TDD using Rspec which uses a different syntax than Ruby. This has been an interesting obstacle to overcome, as we are 
all just getting use to the syntax of Ruby, which is quite nice if I might add. We talked about how the World Wide Web works, 
which was a really interesting lecture that talked about the history of the web and how it got to where it is now. Oh, and Jason
showed us a few terminal commands that deal with the internet, such as 'traceroute' which traces the route taken when connecting to a given ip address, 
really clarifying what latency is and why there are delays. Also I should note that we finally got the green light to use GitX which is a GUI for git. 

Rails!!! Wednesday after break we started rails, learning how to very quickly generate a new rails app, while also 
briefly covering the rails server and setting up the routes. The homework was more challenging this time around-- to get a rails server going with the current time displayed in a certain format; then 
another page that would intro two people to each other. Most of us found this fun, and it turned out 
to be quite helpful struggling so much, affirming the effectiveness of the learning strategies that Jason presented early in the class. This allowed us to understand the purpose of configuring your routes, setting 
up your controller and all actions associated with it. Along with that was the second piece to the MVC (model view 
controller) programming methodology – The View, The View is what the user will see. It was very interesting getting 
these two things to talk to each other in order to render a page view on localhost:3000.

Friday we continued rails along with the introduction of MVC. The new piece to this was the Model, 
this is where all the data for the app is held, it talks to the controller and the database. It is responsible for 
maintaining state of the application, and may be transient or may be tied to a database. Along the way, 
Jason has given us some varied ways to write code, so it's been interesting to consider which approach would be best for given situations.
