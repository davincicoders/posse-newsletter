Week 6 News letter

This week here at Davinci Coders, it was much of the same. Yet, at the same time, all very new… We got back our grades 
for the first assessment, which was over making classes and methods, specifically a Credit Card class with payment methods. 
The test covered the entire process from making a git repo, to setting up our environment. On Monday, we got over our grades 
and then went over step by step how to do the test.

Wednesday we introduced Rails this week after covering more of test driven development, which is a very interesting and 
frustrating way to write code. You write a failing test, then make it pass. Doing this for every small step of the process. 
Now this is using Rspec which uses a different syntax than Ruby. This has been an interesting obstacle to overcome, as we are 
all just getting use to the syntax of Ruby, which is quite nice if I might add. We talked about how the World Wide Web works, 
which was a really interesting lecture that talked about the history of the web and how it got to where it was now. Oh, and Jason
showed us a few terminal commands that deal with the internet, such as traceroute which traces the route an ip address takes, 
really clarifying what latency is and why. Also I should note that we finally got the green light to use GItX which is a GUI for git and github. 

Rails!!! Wednesday after break we started rails, learning how to very quickly generate a new rails app, while also 
briefly covering the rails server and setting up the routes. But mostly we were left to our own devices when it came 
to the homework, which was to get a rails server going with the current time displayed in a certain format. Then 
another page that would intro two people to each other. This was very fun I think most of us found, and it turned out 
to be quite helpful struggling so much. This allowed us to understand the purpose of configuring your routes, setting 
up your controller and all actions associated with it. Along with that was the second piece to the MVC (model view 
controller) programming methodology – The View, The View is what the user will see. It was very interesting getting 
these two things to talk to each other into to render a page view on localhost:3000.

Friday was more rails along with the introduction of MVC as previously mentioned. The new piece to this was the Model, 
this is where all the data for the app is held, it talks to the controller and the database. It is responsible for 
maintaining state of the application, and may be transient or may be tied to a database. Also I should mention Friday, 
Jason went over a really interesting way to write code, it was much more sophisticated than we are used to. Finding it 
really nice to see a different and more elegant approach to coding, even though not all was understood.
